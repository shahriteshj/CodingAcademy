javac -classpath "c:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Tomcat 8.5/lib/servlet-api.jar"  BasicServlet.java


redirect 
	Client -> page a
	a.redirect to b
	response from a to browser
	browser will send request to b
	b will send response to browser
	
	
dispatching: Forward and include
	Client -> page a
	a.dispatching to b
	a will call b
	b will send response to browser

	The main difference is that when you use forward the control is transferred to the next servlet/jsp you are calling, while include retains the control with the current servlet, it just includes the processing done by the calling servlet/jsp(like doing any out.println or other processing)
