redirect 
	Client -> page a
	a.redirect to b
	response from a to browser
	browser will send request to b
	b will send response to browser

redirect can be used to call a servlet from another project/server
dispatching can only work with project	
	
dispatching: Forward and include
	Client -> page a
	a.dispatching to b
	a will call b
	b will send response to browser

	The main difference is that when you use forward the control is transferred to the next servlet/jsp you are calling, while include retains the control with the current servlet, it just includes the processing done by the calling servlet/jsp(like doing any out.println or other processing)
	
context parameters are available to all

config parameters are specific to a particular servlet
	
COOKIE	
cookie is storage in user machine. Browser controls the storage
cookie is a class given in servlet where you can store information. This class only TEXT information
cookie can hold max 4MB of data
For 1 website max 20 cookies can be maintained
Overall max 300 cookies a browser can maintain

Cookies with age (Persistent cookies) go on disk
