	/*
	 * @ManyToOne annotation defines a single-valued association to another entity
	 * class that has many-to-one multiplicity. It is not normally necessary to
	 * specify the target entity explicitly since it can usually be inferred from
	 * the type of the object being referenced.
	 * 
	 * @JoinColumn is used to specify a mapped column 
	 * for joining an entity association.
	 * 
	 * @OneToMany annotation defines a many-valued association with one-to-many
	 * multiplicity. If the collection is defined using generics to specify the
	 * element type, the associated target entity type need not be specified;
	 * otherwise the target entity class must be specified.
	 * 
	 * The association may be bidirectional. In a bidirectional relationship, one of
	 * the sides (and only one) has to be the owner: the owner is responsible for
	 * the association column(s) update. To declare a side as not responsible for
	 * the relationship, the attribute mappedBy is used. mappedBy refers to the
	 * property name of the association on the owner side. In our case, this is
	 * passport. As you can see, you don’t have to (must not) declare the join
	 * column since it has already been declared on the owners side.
