//2 ways to read CSV files in Java.

//First way is by using java.io.BufferedReader and 
//split() method from java.lang.String class, 

//As Java doesn’t support parsing of CSV files natively, 
//we have to rely on third party library. 
//There are many API available on net 

//and second way is by using Apache Commons CSV library's CSVParser class.
